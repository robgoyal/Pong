## PONG

### Purpose

I decided to create a two player pong game which tests my programming skills and trying out a new programming language. This was my first encounter with Javascript and this program uses p5.js, a neat javascript library for drawing. 

Decided to create a basic pong game to test my programming skills. First time using Javascript and decided to create it in p5.js, a neat javascript library for drawing. Code is relatively messy but the game does work and I had a lot of fun trying to debug and troubleshoot errors, which was still difficult for me. 

### Procedure

I first started off viewing a tutorial for p5.js and saw a program which used 5 lines of javascript to bounce a ball horizontally. Then I was intrigued with this library and decided to make a pong game. I built upon that 5 line program to have the ball continuously bounce between the canvas. I then drew paddles and created events for the paddle to move up and down. The final and most difficult step was determining the logic for the ball to bounce between the paddles as well as the scoring logic when a ball passes the paddle. 

This program had a lot of bugs and errors such as the ball being incredibly buggy when it was in between paddles or trying to get the paddle to remain within the canvas. I learned to use Chrome's developer tools to solve these issues. 

Once I got a functioning Pong game, I cleaned up the entire code structure to modularize it to the best of my ability. This project was really fun and was an interesting venture into the very basic world of Javascript. Even though pong is a simple game to implement, the process of writing the game from scratch is quite difficult. The steps with learning new syntax, basic object oriented programming, modularizing code, developing logic, as well as debugging errors. 

### Setup

This is a two player game with the following key setup:

- W and S for the left paddle
- UP and DOWN for the right paddle

### Possible Modifications

I've thought of multiple ways to make modifications to this project that would be interesting and challenging. Some possible ways: 

- Add html/css to make website look better
- Include choices between 1 player vs 2 player
- Create an AI bot for 1 player mode
