# PONG

### About

Decided to create a basic pong game to test my programming skills. First time using Javascript and decided to create it in p5.js, a neat javascript library for drawing. Code is relatively messy but the game does work and I had a lot of fun trying to debug and troubleshoot errors, which was still difficult for me.
